Spring is an application framework and inversion-of-control (IOC) container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application and are ideal for enterprise and internet-based app development. Get a comprehensive overview of Spring in this intermediate-level course with software architect Frank Moley. Frank develops applications and web services with Spring, and shares what he knows about configuring the ApplicationContext (the interface for accessing components, loading files, publishing events, and more), as well as the beans (objects within the Spring IOC container). He demonstrates a modern Java configuration workflow and explores the Spring lifecycle in depth, so you can extend the framework and better troubleshoot any issues you have with your applications. Plus, learn how to use aspect-oriented programming to add behaviors to your apps in a reusable way.

Learning objectives
- Configure the Spring ApplicationContext to access components, load files, publish events, and manage the inversion-of-control (IoC) container for Java applications.
- Implement beans (objects) within the Spring IoC container and apply a modern Java configuration workflow to develop applications and web services with Spring.
- Analyze the Spring lifecycle to extend the framework and troubleshoot issues in Spring-based applications.
- Utilize aspect-oriented programming concepts to integrate reusable behaviors into Java applications in a modular way.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
